# sf-zsi README

This is the extension that is 100% compatible with salesforce vscode extensions. It aims to be 100% backwards compatible as well. It aims to also guarantee the following: If your salesforce CLI works on your command line, then this extension works.

## Features

1) Deploy with status.
2) Generate faux objects.
3) Open org without it always having to be default.
4) Run highlighted apex and show output in console.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.

## Extension Settings

* `sf.zsi.vscode.shouldFocusProblemsWhenDeployFails`: Determine if the "problems" tab should focus when there is an issue during deployment.
* `sf.zsi.vscode.proxy`: Adds environment variables to the shell to allow cli commands to go through.
